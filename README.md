# Three Login Page Redesign


## Design
There are a few key focus points when looking to redesign this page:
1. Slimlining selection options - In the footer particularly - also in the nav-bar/drop-down(mobile)
2. Formatting and positioning - For Desktop there is a large amount of white-space on one side in the main page, which can be effective, but the spacing of content on the otherside is not slick. Consider central and reducing contents on the page, also consider rewording.
3. Modernise with better responsive design and more minimalistic design

After reading into [three branding website](https://www.threebrandcentral.com/), I've decided to stick with the color scheme and font: Helvetica Bold and black and white with splashes of color (in this case two-tone pink), since it ensures continuity with their branding and the rest of the site.
